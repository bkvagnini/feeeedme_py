# feeeedme_py
feeeedme_py is the python version of feeeedme, an app designed to assist me in meal planning by suggesting items from pre-determined lists.

When I got divorced, the hardest part of daily life was not having to both cook AND clean the dishes, but trying to figure out what to eat.

This app will randomize the diffferent components of a meal, incorporating those things that I like to eat (meaning that it will NEVER return beets as a vegetable choice, as it's not in the TXT file).

To use, edit the .txt files, with ONE entry per line. On the last line, do NOT hit Return, or you may get a blank suggestion as one of the fields.
